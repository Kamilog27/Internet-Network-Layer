            It is the sending of information in a computer network to multiple destinations 
            simultaneously, using the most efficient strategy for sending messages, on each 
            link of the network, only once and creating copies when the links in the 
            destinations are divided.In addition to multicasting, there are also sending 
            from one point to another in a network, which is called unicast (unicast), 
            and sending to all nodes in a network which is called broadcasting (broadcast).
           </p>
           <h3>Introduction</h3>
           <p>
            Multicasting is the delivery of information to a group of destinations 
            simultaneously, which use the most efficient strategy to deliver messages 
            to each link in the network only once, creating copies only when the links 
            to the destinations are divided.Before sending the information, a series of 
            parameters must be established. In order to receive it, it is necessary to 
            establish what is called a "multicast group". This multicast group has an 
            associated internet address. The version of the Internet protocol known as 
            IPv4 reserves Type D addresses for multicasting. IP addresses have 32 bits, 
            and type D addresses are those in which the 4 most significant bits are '1110' (
            224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255).The term multicast is sometimes used incorrectly 
            to refer to a multiplexed broadcast send.The word "Multicast" is typically 
            used to refer to IP Multicast, although it is sometimes used to describe ATM 
            (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), Point-to-Multipoint VCs or Infiniband Multicast. 
            The application of the multicast concept at the IP routing level, where routers 
            (or routers) create optimal distribution paths for datagrams sent to a multicast 
            destination address traversing the tree in real time. Also other implementations 
            of the multicast distribution strategy such as:
            <ol>
                <li>IP Multicast</li>
                <li>Internet Relay Chat</li>
                <li>NNTP</li>
                <li>PSYC</li>
                <li>Peercasting using point-to-point connections.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

           <h3>Multicast technologies on the Internet</h3>
           <p>P multicasting is a technique for sending to many recipients over an IP 
               infrastructure. Multicasting uses the network infrastructure efficiently 
               so that the source sends a packet only once, even if it has to be delivered 
               to a large number of receivers. The nodes in the network are careful to reproduce 
               the packet to reach multiple receivers only where it is necessary.
            The IP multicast group address, the multicast distribution tree, and the receiver 
            that drives the tree creation are key concepts in IP multicast.A group multicast 
            IP address is used by senders and receivers to send and receive content. 
            Sources use the group address as the destination IP address in their data packets. 
            The receivers use this group address to inform the network that they are interested 
            in receiving packets sent to that group. For example, if some content is associated 
            with group 239.1.1.1, the source will send data packets destined for 239.1.1.1. 
            The receivers of that content will inform the network that they are interested in 
            receiving data packets sent to group 239.1.1.1. The receiver "binds" to 239.1.1.1. 
            The protocol used by the receivers joined in a group is called Internet Group 
            Management Protocol or IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).
        </p>
             
             <h3>Using multicast</h3>
             <p> 
                IP Multicast to send to a certain group, you do not need a source that 
                knows about the group's receivers. The construction of the multicast tree 
                is initiated by network nodes that are close to the receivers or is driven 
                by the receiver itself. This allows you to send to a large population 
                receiver.While IP Multicast uses a designated multicast address, 
                Explicit Multi-Unicast (XCAST) uses the unicast addresses of all 
                destinations. Since the IP packet size is limited, in general, XCAST 
                cannot be used for multicast groups with a large number of destinations.
