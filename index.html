          <h4>IPv4</h4>
          <img class="image"src="img/ipv4.jpg" alt="ipv4">
          <p>Internet Protocol version 4
            It is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP), an Internet-based networking protocol,
            and it was the first version implemented in 1983 for the production of ARPANET. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses,
            limited to 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 unique addresses, many (LAN). Due to the enormous growth that all this has had
            of electronic security and automation combined with the fact that Since there is a waste of addresses in many cases,
             it was observed several years ago that IPv4 addresses were scarce.
            This limitation helped stimulate the study on the feasibility of implementing a new IPv6 protocol, which in 2016 is already
             in the early stages of testing, and which is expected to end up replacing the current IPv4 protocol.
           </p>
           <h3>Addressing</h3>
           <p>IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses that limit the address space to 4,294,967,296 (2^32) possible addresses.
             IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) reserves special address blocks for private networks
             (in total 16 777 216 addresses, that is, (2^24), as well as multicast addresses (268 435 456 addresses, that is, 2^28).
           </p>

           <h3>Address representations</h3>
           <p>IPv4 addresses can be represented in any notation that expresses a 32-bit integer 
             value. Most of the time they are written in decimal notation, which consists of four 
             octets of the address expressed individually in decimal numbers, and separated one 
             from the next by periods</p>

             <h3>Assignment</h3>
             <p>In the original design of IPv4, an IP address was divided into two parts: the network identifier was the 
               most significant octet of the address, and the host identifier (host or guest) was the rest of the address. 
               The latter was also called the resting field. This structure allowed a maximum of 256 network identifiers, 
               which were quickly found to be inappropriate.
              To overcome this limit, the most significant address octet was redefined in 1981 to create network classes, in a system that later became known as classful networks. The revised system defined five classes. Classes A, B, and C had different bit lengths for network identification. The rest of the address was used as before to identify a host within a network. Due to the different sizes of fields in different classes, each network class had a different ability to address its hosts. In addition to the three classes for addressing hosts, Class D was defined for multicast addressing, and Class E was reserved for future applications.</p>
              <h3>Fragmentation and reassembly</h3>
              <p>The Internet Protocol (IP) allows networks to communicate with each other. The design accommodates 
                networks of diverse physical natures; it is independent of the technology used in the layer immediately 
                below, the Link Layer. Networks with different hardware usually differ not only in transmission speed, 
                but also in their Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). When a network wants to transmit datagrams to a network with 
                a lower MTU, it must fragment its datagrams. In IPv4, this function is performed in the Internet layer, 
                and it is carried out in IPv4 routers, which only require this layer as the highest implemented in their design.
                In contrast, IPv6, the new generation of Internet Protocol, does not allow routers to carry out such
               fragmentation; it is the hosts that determine the MTU before sending datagrams.</p>
               <h3>Fragmentation</h3>
               <p>When a router receives a packet, it examines the destination address and determines the exit 
                 interface to use and its MTU. If the packet size is greater than the MTU and the No Fragmentation 
                 (DF) bit is 0 in the packet header, the router will have to fragment the packet.
                The router splits the packet into chunks. The maximum size of each fragment is the MTU minus the 
                size of the IP header (between 20 and 60 bytes). The router puts each fragment inside its packet.
                These fragments receive the following changes:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The total size field is the chunk size.</li>
                  <li>The more fragments (MF) flag is equal to 1 in all packets except the last one.</li>
                  <li>The fragment offset field is on, based on the fragment offset in the original data load. It is measured in units of 8-byte blocks.</li>
                  <li>The header checksum field is recomputed.</li>
                </ol>
              <h3>Address representation</h3>
              <p>IPv4 addresses can be written to express a 32-bit integer, but are typically written with decimal
                 places separated by periods. These 3-digit decimal numbers are called "octets", because in binary 
                 they require 8 digits (8 bits) to be represented. The following table shows various forms of IPv4 
                 address representation:
